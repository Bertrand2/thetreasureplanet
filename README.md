# The Treasure Planet (1982)

**Narrator (Filipe):** *whispering in the cosmos* The black hole. This is the black hole. The distorted space has withdrawn into itself. I am alone again, moving toward a point in time where I shall merge myself again. To relive the nightmare adventure. I am Filipe. 7-3-7-5.

**Narrator (Filipe):** *whispering in the cosmos* Memories. Mother. How she succumbed. Anna-Maria... will I ever see you again. Gone, everything, everyone, gone. I must return alone. For it is my memory and my responsibility. Back, back to where it all began.

**Narrator (Filipe):** Earth. The Earth of my youth. The home of my memories. Memories distorted by time and distance. I struggle to give form to the bewildering parade of sensory perceptions. Alien, yet somehow familiar forms, imperfectly recalled.

**Narrator (Filipe):** Again, I am the young Filipe, returning home from the space academy. Again I shall encounter the old space pirate, Billy Bones. Again for the hundredth time he will ask if I've seen anyone suspicious hanging around inquiring about him.

**Billy:** Arrr, you scared me half to death. Tell me Filipe, have you seen any suspicious-looking characters hanging around the neighborhood making enquiries about [me?] (end cut off)

**Filipe:** Are you expecting someone, Billy?

**Billy:** Of course! Why else would I ask?

**Filipe:** The only really suspicious character I've seen around this neighborhood is you.

**Billy:** You son of a space serpent how dare you bandy words with Billy Bones. Listen to me!

**Billy:** I'm not a space tramp. I was a bloodthirsty terror of the starry oceans when you were still just a baby in your mother's arms. When I was a young man sailing space with Captain Flint in search of treasure, nothing stood in our way. Humpf! [???] I can tell you stories that would curl your teeth.

**Filipe:** Did you ever find any, Mr. Bones? Treasure, that is.

**Billy:** What? None of your business!

**Filipe:** Who is Captain Flint, Mr Bones? Is he the suspicious visitor you keep asking me about?

**Billy:** Er, you are not likely to see him around here!

**Filipe:** Why?

**Billy:** He's dead, that's why. And it's only a matter of time before they get around to me too, the scum! Captain Flint was [???] ever wanna know but I can't say the same for that scurvy crew of his.

**Filipe:** And I'll bet you were the scurviest one of the lot, weren't you, Mr. Bones?

**Billy:** Of course! [*confusion noises*] What am I saying?! You're just trying to catch me off guard, aren't you? Like everyone else you're hoping you can trick me into betraying the secret I've been protecting all this time. You want me to tell you about the map, but my lips are sealed.

**Filipe:** Map? What map? Mr. Bones, where did you go? You were talking about a map. Mr. Bones? Where are you? That's funny, he disappeared. Mr. Bones? Billy? Billy Bones? Where could he have gone?

**Billy:** What's that? Ah! Oh no! It's them! They got me! AAAAAAAOW! GAAAHAHOW! Miss me! Oh no! It's the paralyzer ray! I can't move! All is lost, gone! [*spinning Billy Bones' noises*] [*falling Billy Bones' noises*] Stop, turn it off, I can't stand it anymore!

**Black Dog:** Guess who, Billy Bones?

**Billy:** It's you, Black Dog?

**Black Dog:** Yes.

**Billy:** What do you want?

**Black Dog:** You know what I want.

**Billy:** No, Black Dog!

**Black Dog:** Aah, but yes, Billy Bones! I have been sent to serve you with the Black Spot. Gnap! Unless of course you return the map you stole.

**Billy:** Map? I don't know what you mean [*vibrating Billy Bones' noises*] [*screaming*]

**Black Dog:** It's no use Billy. You can't escape. I can't even help you now.

**Billy:** Scum! You call yourself a friend!

**Black Dog:** It doesn't have to be this way. Just give them the map. You know what it means if I give you the Spot.

**Billy:** You woudln't give me the Black Spot?! Gahah!!

**Black Dog:** I'm sorry, but you don't give me any choice in this matter, do you know? So, I've [???] you of the power invested in me by our fellow pirates I must now present you with the Black Spot.

**Billy:** NoooOOoOOOoo! DOoOOoon't do iiiit!!

**Black Dog:** For old times sake I'll give you one more chance my friend, but I'm afraid that's got to be it. Now then, will you hand over captain Flint's treasure map immediately?

**Billy:** Alright, alright. I'll give you your bloody treasure map, Black Dog, and you know what you can do with it. Now you just wait right here.

**Black Dog:** Okay Billy

**Billy:** Give me the Black Spot, really? If they want to serve a death summons on Billy Bones they'll have to send a far better man than Black Dog, the fools!

**Black Dog:** Hey, I felt a raindrop

**Billy:** [*flying Billy Bones' noises*]

**Black Dog:** You know, I almost belive you did that on purpose. Come on Billy, cut it off! Billy? Where are you?

**Billy:**

**Black Dog:**

**Billy:** Go away and leave me alone, Black Dog! Gaah!

I'm tired of playing games with you Black Dog. You're never gonna get that map away from me this way so give up! I'll always be one jump ahead of you.

**Black Dog:** I kept you hoppin', didn't I? Now are you ready to turn over that treasure map?

Alright Black Dog, here's your cursed treasure map!

**Black Dog:** This is a bomb.

**Billy:** That's right.

**Black Dog:** I didn't ask you for a bomb, Billy.

**Billy:** [??? 9:20]

**Black Dog:** That statue is a very good likeness of old Billy Bones! I think Billy's nose is a little bit longer though. Billy can't stand being tickled. Now I wonder if this statue is ticklish. 

**Billy:** Mhm-hmmm! Don't be foolish! Statues can't be ticklish. Mhm-hmmm!

**Black Dog:** Oorh, I'll bet your hand is ticklish

**Billy:** I'm not ticklish! See!

Oh no! The Black Spot! Gnohooohooooo...

**Black Dog:** It was a pleasure seeing you again Billy, mmh mmh, now that you've got the Black Spot, I guess that completes our business expect for the funeral arrangements which I'll take care of for you.

**Billy:** Black Dog, you were my friend, how could you do this?

**Black Dog:** Don't take it personally Billy, we're still friends. I'll put flowers on your grave every sunday morning.

**Billy:** Oooh no! I'm doomed! Doomed! Doomed!

**Filipe:** What's wrong with you Mr. Bones?

**Billy:** Mh? What's wrong? Oh nothing much unless you count the fact that I'm about to die.

**Filipe:** But you appear to be in perfect health.

**Billy:** AAARH! It's all over for me! I've been given the summons.

**Filipe:** You mean the Black Spot of doom? Sheer superstition!

**Billy:** Think so? Well, listen : 20 men have died already. And all because of this. Captain Flint's treasure map!

**Filipe:** A treasure map? Ridiculous!

**Billy:** You think so, eh? You're to young to have heard of Captain Flint's treasure, buried on a secret planet.

**Filipe:** And you have a treasure planet map?

**Billy:** This is it Filipe. But it doesn't matter to me now, it's too late, they gave me the Black Spot and it's my duty as a conscienscious pirate to drop dead at once!

**Filipe:** I can't believe it.

**Billy:** No? Just watch this [*Billy Bones dying noises*]

**Filipe:** I'll be damned! He wasn't kiddin'! I better report this to the commander.

Ah! It must be those pirates!

**alling Commander Smollet! Please come in!

**Smollet:** *over audio transmission* This is Commander Smollet, come in Filipe

**Filipe:** Commander, I must see you at once! It's about treasure planet, I have the map.

============

**Smollet:** Come in! I'm Commander Smollet, what can I do for you?

**N°3:** A haircut. Just a trim. Nothing off the top and don't touch the sideburns, okay?

**Smollet:** I'm not a barber, I'm the space fleet commander!

**N°3:** Well, what do we have here? It looks like a sink! What a good place to get a treasure map in! HhhHHEllLPP! OOoOOooOH!

**Smollet:** Mh, did you say treasure map?

**N°3:** Me? No! I haven't the slightest interest in buried treasure, nor am I interested in a young cadet named Filipe. Not even a teeny weeny little bit interested in him or his treasure map.

**Smollet:** Then why did you come?

**N°3:** Erm, I want a haircut.

**Smollet:** One haircut, coming up.

**N°3:** AAAAAAAAAaaaAAAAaAAaAAH! OOooooooOOOOh! Waaaaaoooh!

**Pigman:** Excuse me, I'd like a hamburger with ketchup and mustard and onions and tomato and lettuce and a chocolate milkshake.

**Smollet:** Is that for here or to go?

**Pigman:** I'd like to eat it here and take it with me too if possible. By the way, not that I'm interested, but does a young man named Filipe with a treasure map ever come in here?

**Smollet:** Did I hear you say treasure map?

**Pigman:** Who, me? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH OOF OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!

**N°3:** AHU AHU AHU! AHU AHU AHU!

**N°4:** Hello there! Can you help me? I'm blind as you can see!

**Smollet:** So, you're a blind man hey? And what do you want, pray tell?

**N°4:** Well, what do you suggest?

**Smollet:** A treasure map?

**N°4:** Yeah! ...I mean no! Not a treasure map. I haven't even the slightest interested in a treasure map. I wonder, could you tell me the time?

**Smollet:** I'd be happy to! Mh mh mh. As you can see by my clock, it's 3.15.

**N°4:** That's not a clock, it's a barometer! Are you making fun of a poor blind man?

**Smollet:** I was just testing you. Now would you mind standing on that red board over there?

**N°4:** Mmmmmmmmh you mean that green board! Sure I'll stand on it.

**Smollet:** You have excellent color perception my friend, especially for a blind person.

**N°4:** Okay, I'm standing on it. Now what do you want me to do?

**Smollet:** You've got to get up pretty early in the morning if you're going to try to fool me.

**Filipe, you're cleared for landing at 7 - 3 port.

**Filipe:** Commander Smollet, I have brought the map.

**Smollet:** Mmmmh. Ah-Ha! Filipe, this is an authenthic star map. I shows the exact location of Captain Flint's fabulous [?? 16:42] but very pirate loot on a secret treasure planet. We've no time to waste. Filipe, we have to get to that treasure before those pirates do. They know we have the map and they'll be watching our every move, so we must proceed with absolute caution but with haste as well. We must assemble a crew immediatly. I'll be captain of course, and you can be the cabin boy.

**Long John:** [*evil laugh*] I have come to volunteer my services as your first mate commander.

**Smollet:** And what is your name my good fellow?

**Long John:** I am known as Long John Silver, commander Smollet. I have 15 years of space experience.

**Smollet:** Long John Silver, eh? I hereby appoint you first mate of the Espagnola.

**Long John:** At your service commander Smollet, hin hin.

**Smollet:** Very good then. We have a spaceship, commander, first mate and a cabin boy. All we need now is a crew.

**Long John:** Just leave that off to me, commander, I can round up a fine crew in no time whatever.

============

**Smollet:** Handsomely done Long John! They look like an able space crew. Gezondheid! Attention! Prepare for launch into hyperspace.

============

**Narrator (Filipe):** The Espagnola is a fine ship. Soaring to endless stretches of deep space with little effort. There is no day or night in space, and the concept of time has little meaning. To us, time is just tedious[?], as little happens outside the routine of our serene [??19:18] through space. Most of the ship's functions are commanded by unfailable computers, and there is little for any of us to do except observe in case something goes wrong. I sometimes wish that something would go wrong, just to break the monotony.

============

**Smollet:** Cabin boy report to the commander.

**Smollet:** *over speakers* Cabin boy report to the commander.

**Smollet:** Navigation engineer number one, watch the radiation level in the power drive.

**Filipe:** Sir, cabin boy reporting as ordered, sir.

**Smollet:** And my immortal(?) engineer, check the artificial gravity generator.

**N°4:** I just checked it yesterday and it's still there commander Smollet!
