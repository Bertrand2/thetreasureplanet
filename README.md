# The Treasure Planet (1982)

**Narrator (Filipe):** *whispering in the cosmos* The black hole. This is the black hole. The distorted space has withdrawn into itself. I am alone again, moving toward a point in time where I shall merge myself again. To relive the nightmare adventure. I am Filipe. 7-3-7-5.

**Narrator (Filipe):** *whispering in the cosmos* Memories. Mother. How she succumbed. Anna-Maria... will I ever see you again. Gone, everything, everyone, gone. I must return alone. For it is my memory and my responsibility. Back, back to where it all began.

**Narrator (Filipe):** Earth. The Earth of my youth. The home of my memories. Memories distorted by time and distance. I struggle to give form to the bewildering parade of sensory perceptions. Alien, yet somehow familiar forms, imperfectly recalled.

**Narrator (Filipe):** Again, I am the young Filipe, returning home from the space academy. Again I shall encounter the old space pirate, Billy Bones. Again for the hundredth time he will ask if I've seen anyone suspicious hanging around inquiring about him.

**Billy:** Arrr, you scared me half to death. Tell me Filipe, have you seen any suspicious-looking characters hanging around the neighborhood making enquiries about [me?] (end cut off)

**Filipe:** Are you expecting someone, Billy?

**Billy:** Of course! Why else would I ask?

**Filipe:** The only really suspicious character I've seen around this neighborhood is you.

**Billy:** You son of a space serpent how dare you bandy words with Billy Bones. Listen to me!

**Billy:** I'm not a space tramp. I was a bloodthirsty terror of the starry oceans when you were still just a baby in your mother's arms. When I was a young man sailing space with Captain Flint in search of treasure, nothing stood in our way. Humpf! [???] I can tell you stories that would curl your teeth.

**Filipe:** Did you ever find any, Mr. Bones? Treasure, that is.

**Billy:** What? None of your business!

**Filipe:** Who is Captain Flint, Mr Bones? Is he the suspicious visitor you keep asking me about?

**Billy:** Er, you are not likely to see him around here!

**Filipe:** Why?

**Billy:** He's dead, that's why. And it's only a matter of time before they get around to me too, the scum! Captain Flint was [???] ever wanna know but I can't say the same for that scurvy crew of his.

**Filipe:** And I'll bet you were the scurviest one of the lot, weren't you, Mr. Bones?

**Billy:** Of course! [*confusion noises*] What am I saying?! You're just trying to catch me off guard, aren't you? Like everyone else you're hoping you can trick me into betraying the secret I've been protecting all this time. You want me to tell you about the map, but my lips are sealed.

**Filipe:** Map? What map? Mr. Bones, where did you go? You were talking about a map. Mr. Bones? Where are you? That's funny, he disappeared. Mr. Bones? Billy? Billy Bones? Where could he have gone?

**Billy:** What's that? Ah! Oh no! It's them! They got me! AAAAAAAOW! GAAAHAHOW! Miss me! Oh no! It's the paralyzer ray! I can't move! All is lost, gone! [*spinning Billy Bones' noises*] [*falling Billy Bones' noises*] Stop, turn it off, I can't stand it anymore!

**Black Dog:** Guess who, Billy Bones?

**Billy:** It's you, Black Dog?

**Black Dog:** Yes.

**Billy:** What do you want?

**Black Dog:** You know what I want.

**Billy:** No, Black Dog!

**Black Dog:** Aah, but yes, Billy Bones! I have been sent to serve you with the Black Spot. Gnap! Unless of course you return the map you stole.

**Billy:** Map? I don't know what you mean [*vibrating Billy Bones' noises*] [*screaming*]

**Black Dog:** It's no use Billy. You can't escape. I can't even help you now.

**Billy:** Scum! You call yourself a friend!

**Black Dog:** It doesn't have to be this way. Just give them the map. You know what it means if I give you the Spot.

**Billy:** You wouldn't give me... the Black Spot?! Gahah!!

**Black Dog:** I'm sorry, but you don't give me any choice in this matter, do you know? So, I've [???] you of the power invested in me by our fellow pirates I must now present you with the Black Spot.

**Billy:** NoooOOoOOOoo! DOoOOoon't do iiiit!!

**Black Dog:** For old times sake I'll give you one more chance my friend, but I'm afraid that's got to be it. Now then, will you hand over captain Flint's treasure map immediately?

**Billy:** Alright, alright. I'll give you your bloody treasure map, Black Dog, and you know what you can do with it. Now you just wait right here.

**Black Dog:** Okay Billy

**Billy:** "Give me the Black Spot", really? If they want to serve a death summons on Billy Bones they'll have to send a far better man than Black Dog, the fools!

**Black Dog:** Hey, I felt a raindrop

**Billy:** [*flying Billy Bones' noises*]

**Black Dog:** You know, I almost believe you did that on purpose. Come on Billy, cut it off! Billy? Where are you?

**Billy:**

**Black Dog:**

**Billy:** Go away and leave me alone, Black Dog! Gahuu!

**Billy:** I'm tired of playing games with you Black Dog. You're never gonna get that map away from me this way so give up! I'll always be one jump ahead of you.

**Black Dog:** I kept you hoppin', didn't I? Now are you ready to turn over that treasure map?

**Billy:** Alright Black Dog, here's your cursed treasure map!

**Black Dog:** This is a bomb.

**Billy:** That's right.

**Black Dog:** I didn't ask you for a bomb, Billy.

**Billy:** [??? 9:20]

**Black Dog:** That statue is a very good likeness of old Billy Bones! I think Billy's nose is a little bit longer though. Billy can't stand being tickled. Now I wonder if this statue is ticklish.

**Billy:** Mhm-hmmm! Don't be foolish! Statues can't be ticklish. Mhm-hmmm!

**Black Dog:** Oorh, I'll bet your hand is ticklish.

**Billy:** I'm not ticklish! See!

**Billy:** Oh no! The Black Spot! Gnohooohooooo...

**Black Dog:** It was a pleasure seeing you again Billy, mmh mmh, now that you've got the Black Spot, I guess that completes our business except for the funeral arrangements which I'll take care of for you.

**Billy:** Black Dog, you were my friend, how could you do this?

**Black Dog:** Don't take it personally Billy, we're still friends. I'll put flowers on your grave every sunday morning.

**Billy:** Oooh no! I'm doomed! Doomed! Doomed!

**Filipe:** What's wrong with you Mr. Bones?

**Billy:** Mh? What's wrong? Oh nothing much unless you count the fact that I'm about to die.

**Filipe:** But you appear to be in perfect health.

**Billy:** AAARH! It's all over for me! I've been given the summons.

**Filipe:** You mean the Black Spot of doom? Sheer superstition!

**Billy:** Think so? Well, listen: twenty men have died already. And all because of this. Captain Flint's treasure map!

**Filipe:** A treasure map? Ridiculous!

**Billy:** You think so, eh? You're to young to have heard about Captain Flint's fabulous treasure, buried on a secret planet.

**Filipe:** And you have the treasure planet map?

**Billy:** This is it Filipe. But it doesn't matter to me now, it's too late, they gave me the Black Spot and it's my duty as a conscientious pirate to drop dead at once!

**Filipe:** I can't believe it.

**Billy:** No? Just watch this [*Billy Bones dying noises*]

**Filipe:** I'll be damned! He wasn't kiddin'! I'd better report this to the commander.

**Filipe:** Ah! It must be those pirates!

**Filipe:** Calling Commander Smollett! Please come in!

**Smollett:** *over audio transmission* This is Commander Smollett, come in Filipe.

**Filipe:** Commander, I must see you at once! It's about treasure planet, I have the map.

============

**Smollett:** Come in! I'm Commander Smollett, what can I do for you?

**N°3:** A haircut. Just a trim. Nothing off the top and don't touch the sideburns, okay?

**Smollett:** I'm not a barber, I'm the space fleet commander!

**N°3:** Well, what do we have here? It looks like a sink! What a good place to get a treasure map in! HhhHHEllLPP! OOoOOooOH!

**Smollett:** Mh, did you say treasure map?

**N°3:** Me? No! I haven't the slightest interest in buried treasure, nor am I interested in a young cadet named Filipe. Not even a teeny weeny little bit interested in him or his treasure map.

**Smollett:** And why have you come?

**N°3:** Erm, I want a haircut.

**Smollett:** One haircut, coming up.

**N°3:** AAAAAAAAAaaaAAAAaAAaAAH! OOooooooOOOOh! Waaaaaoooh!

**Pigman:** Excuse me, I'd like a hamburger with ketchup and mustard and onions and tomato and lettuce and a chocolate milkshake.

**Smollett:** Is that for here or to go?

**Pigman:** I'd like to eat it here and take it with me too if possible. By the way, not that I'm interested, but does a young man named Filipe with a treasure map ever come in here?

**Smollett:** Did I hear you say treasure map?

**Pigman:** Who, me? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH OOF OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!

**N°3:** AHU AHU AHU! AHU AHU AHU!

**N°4:** Hello there! Can you help me? I'm blind as you can see!

**Smollett:** So, you're a blind man hey? And what do you want, pray tell?

**N°4:** Well, what do you suggest?

**Smollett:** A treasure map?

**N°4:** Yeah! ...I mean no! Not a treasure map. I haven't even the slightest interested in a treasure map. I wonder, could you tell me the time?

**Smollett:** I'd be happy to! Mh mh mh. As you can see by my clock, it's 3.15.

**N°4:** That's not a clock, it's a barometer! Are you making fun of a poor blind man?

**Smollett:** I was just testing you. Now would you mind standing on that red board over there?

**N°4:** Mmmmmmmmh you mean that green board! Sure I'll stand on it.

**Smollett:** You have excellent color perception my friend, especially for a blind person.

**N°4:** Okay, I'm standing on it. Now what do you want me to do?

**Smollett:** You've got to get up pretty early in the morning if you're going to try to fool me.

**Smollett:** Filipe, you're cleared for landing at 7 - 3 port.

**Filipe:** Commander Smollett, I have brought the map.

**Smollett:** Mmmmh. Ah-Ha! Filipe, this is an authenthic star map. It shows the exact location of Captain Flint's fabulous trove of buried pirate loot on a secret treasure planet. We've no time to waste. Filipe, we have to get to that treasure before those pirates do. They know we have the map and they'll be watching our every move, so we must proceed with absolute caution but with haste as well. We must assemble a crew immediately. I'll be captain of course, and you can be the cabin boy.

**Long John:** [*evil laugh*] I have come to volunteer my services as your first mate commander.

**Smollett:** And what is your name my good fellow?

**Long John:** I am known as Long John Silver, commander Smollett. I have 15 years of space experience.

**Smollett:** Long John Silver, eh? I hereby appoint you first mate of the Hispaniola.

**Long John:** At your service commander Smollett, hin hin.

**Smollett:** Very good then. We have a spaceship, commander, first mate and the cabin boy. All we need now is a crew.

**Long John:** Just leave that off to me, commander, I can round up a fine crew in no time whatever.

============

**Smollett:** Handsomely done Long John! They look like an able space crew. Gezondheid! Attention! Prepare for launch into hyperspace.

============

**Narrator (Filipe):** The Hispaniola is a fine ship. Soaring to endless stretches of deep space with little effort. There is no day or night in space, and the concept of time has little meaning. To us, time is just tedium, as little happens outside the routine of our serene sojourn through space. Most of the ship's functions are commanded by unfailable computers, and there is little for any of us to do except observe in case something goes wrong. I sometimes wish that something would go wrong, just to break the monotony.

============

**Smollett:** Cabin boy report to the commander.

**Smollett:** *over speakers* Cabin boy report to the commander.

**Smollett:** Navigation engineer number one, watch the radiation level in the power drive.

**Filipe:** Sir, cabin boy reporting as ordered, sir.

**Smollett:** And my immortal(?) (environmental?) engineer, check the artificial gravity generator.

**N°4:** I just checked it yesterday and it's still there commander Smollett!

**N°3:** [???] is really normal, commander.

**Smollett:** Computer program analyzer number one, check the whatchamacallit then the thingamajig and report.

**N°1:** Okie dokie and hunky-dory commander. Whoop! Ha! Haha.

**Smollett:** Commander's log aboard the starship Hispaniola. Stardate: 7-4-2-5. Destination: Treasure Planet. Estimated arrival: 8 days, 4 hours, 10 minutes and 5 seconds, give or take. All systems [???]. Everything functioning perfectly. It's another typical, boring day in space.

**Black Dog:** Coming, coming, coming, coming, coming, coming. The battery appears to be going dead, commander.

**Smollett:** Okay Filipe, assemble the crew immediately, emergency one!

**N°2, N°3, N°4:** [*Bulgarian musical interlude*]

**Smollett:** Filipe, find first mate Long John Silver and bring him to me [??? 22:29] urgent!

**Parrot:** [*dying sounds*] I need electricity!

**Parrot:** That's much better, eh!

**N°3:** Alright who turned that blasted parrot back on?

**Parrot:** Waaah! Villains! Waah! Scoundrels!

**N°3:** Hey can you guys sing melancholy baby?

**Long John:** I heard all that singing and dancing around you scum! You behaving like a bunch of rotten slacken(? 23:20) sailors.

**Long John:** Now cut that out! Report on the condition of your circuitry?

**N°2:** [*what the fuck* 23:27] If I only have all your mother, boys.

**N°4:** Take my wife, please.

**N°3:** Shave [??? 23:36] haircut, two bits!

**N°2:** [??? 23:39]

**Long John:** We are approaching a magnetic storm! I know that can be rough on bio-robots but I'll make a few adjustments in your circuitry and you'll be okay, just try to be calm now, it's a simple adjustement. Mmh, okay, okay, done! How much is 3,243,749 multiplied by 9,743,301?

**N°2:** 21!

**Long John:** That's close enough.

**Parrot:** Stupid! If brains were dynamite you wouldn't have enough to blow your nose, Long John!

**Long John:** All right! Which one of you turned that plastic bird back on?

**Parrot:** Kwaaak! You don't turn me on and that's for sure!

**Long John:** Grrr, one of these day I'm gonna have a boiled parrot stew. [*mumble*] You bio-robots pay attention to me now. Program! Your job is to get that map from commander Smollett. Just remember, I am your master and you are not allowed to take orders from anybody else! There will be no mistakes and no failures, is that clear?

**N°2, 3 and 4:** We hear and obey you!

**Long John:** By all rights that treasure is mine; I inherited Captain Flint's command and his treasure as well! It isn't just gold, whoever owns that treasure can become the master of the whole universe.

**N°2, 3 and 4:** Wow that's impressive!

**Long John:** I don't like to brag but I got a natural aptitude for the job. I wanted to be master of the universe all my life. I've made a lot of duels and I deserve the job. Now it's up to you, what say you?

**N°4:** You can depend on us no to fail you John Silver.

**Long John:** Give me your hand on it!

**Smollett:** [*Through a speaker*] Attention all hands, attention all hands! Emergency one, emergency one! We are entering the magnetic storm, secure your posts and hang on, it's gonna be [??? 25:32]

============

**Smollett:** Stand by your posts and try not to panic, men. Steady!

**Filipe:** Oooooh! Commander, what's happening?

**N°2:** [*pain screams*]

============

**Filipe:** Commander? Commander Smollett? Where am I? How did I get here? You, sir. Could you help me please? And don't know where or who I am.

**Smollett:** Your name is Jim Hawkins

**Filipe:** Oh, Hawkins. And you?

**Smollett:** I'm Captain Smollett of the Hispaniola and you're my cabin boy of Treasure Island Fame by Robert Louis Stevenson. Welcome to the 17th century. Now that you know who and where you are, suppose you report back to duty all right?

**Filipe:** I- I don't understand.

**Smollett:** Neither do I but I'll try to explain it to you. The magnetic storm has thrown us back through the fourth dimension and into the 17th century. We are now existing in another spatial continuum. I'm sure you'll join me in the devout hope that this is merely a temporary condition.

**Filipe:** I'm not sure I understand.

**Smollett:** There are more things in Heaven and Earth than are dreamed of in your philosophy Filipe.

**Filipe:** Uh Hawkins sir, Jim Hawkins.

**Smollett:** Whatever.

**Filipe:** Oh, what are those?

**Filipe:** [*trembling voice*] Ooooh! Ooh, oooh! Commander, Commander!

**Smollett:** [*humming music*] Just ignore them, Filipe. [*continues humming*]

**Long John:** [*evil laugh*]

**Parrot:** [*kwak of fear*]

**N°2, 3 and 4:** [*fear noises*]

**Black Dog:** Oh hell no, please! Commander, uh, see if these fresh batteries will help. [*pain screams*]

**Filipe:** [*pain screams*]

**Smollett:** Good work Filipe, we're going back to real time now.

============


**Smollett:** Attention all hands! Secure all positions, resume normal operations.

**Black Dog:** Filipe, you saved my life.

**Filipe:** Mmmh.

**Black Dog:** No, you risked your own life to save mine. Thank you Filipe.

**Filipe:** Mmmh.

**Black Dog:** My friend, I'll devote my life to you.

============

**Filipe:** Commander what are we gonna do about this? We have a gang of pirates running our ship.

**Smollett:** There isn't very much we can do now Filipe. We can't run the ship by ourselves. We'll pretend we know nothing and we'll keep our eyes open but above all we must not let that treasure map fall into Long John Silver's hands.

**Parrot:** [??? 31:42]

============

**Smollett:** All hands prepare for touchdown!

**Smollett:** [*Through a speaker*] Secure your positions fasten your seat belts and observe the no smoking lights. Stand by retro Rockets, prepare for countdown. 10! 9! 8! 7! 6! 5! 4! 3! 2! 1!

**Smollett:** Touchdown accomplished 1 PM Monday April 4 25 81. The Hispaniola has landed safely on Treasure Planet, wish us luck!

============

**Long John:** Excuse me Commander? Now that we've reached our destination, may I ask what we're looking for?

**Smollett:** Yes, this is a mineral exploration.

**Long John:** Coal, oil? Stick them up! And now with your permission Commander Smollett I'll relieve you of the responsibility of that treasure map.

**Smollett:** You!

**Long John:** Thank you Commander for taking care of it for me. At last it's mine and I shall be Master of the Universe!

**N°2, 3 and 4:** Uh!

**Long John:** Now come on, men!

**Parrot:** Krrrraaaa! Not so fast Long John Silver, you still have to reckon with me!

**Long John:** What are you talking about? Hey!

**Parrot:** Thanks for taking care of it for me long John!

**Long John:** You dirty bird! Oh that makes me so mad. All right you scum! After that parrot and don't come back without it!

**Parrot:** It's hard to fly in this heavy atmosphere and I'm not really built for running. Oh boy. Taxi taxi! Oh there's never one round when you need one, krraaa!

**N°2, 3 and 4:** [*panting*]

**Parrot:** How about that, I'm running 10 seconds ahead of the world's record! I may be the new champion on Formula One parrots.

**N°2:** [*panting*]

**Parrot:** Stray over the pack but tiring fast, it may be a photo finish folks!

**N°3:** [*trumpet panting*]

**Parrot:** [*laugh*]

**N°2, 3 and 4 and Long John:** [*panting*]

**Parrot:** Bravo, congratulations!

**N°3:** Thank you.

**Parrot:** You came in second and on behalf of the entire judging committee I'd like to present you with a token of our esteem. Please limit your acceptance speech to one minute.

**N°3:** I just don't know what to say I just want to thank all the little people who made this honor possible.

[*explosion*]

**Long John:** Now then I'll trouble you for my treasure map.

**Parrot:** Right on target!

**Long John:** You refugee from a badminton game, hand over that treasure map right now!

**Parrot:** Kwaaa, you'll never get it Long John you might as well give up! Aaah! On second thought I'll give up. [*screams*]

**Long John:** Hin hin! Ooooh? Grr, it's a fake! Captain Smollett switched star maps on me and gave me a map to the movie stars on the Beverly Hills!

**Parrot:** I don't no about you but I'm getting out of here, ciao!

**Long John:** I think we have a problem.

**N°2, 3 and 4:** [*panic screams*]

============

**N°3:** It's a tough life being a cartoon character yuk! Why couldn't I get a nice situation comedy?

**Parrot:** It was our greed and our lust for power that got us into this situation you know? Waaah!

**Long John:** This is more than I bargained for, those fiery monsters must have been trained to protect Captain Flint's treasure.

I've lost count of the days we've been marooned here the food is all gone the commander hasn't spoken a word he just
53:23
brewed staring into space the silence is broken only by the whimpering of the parrot whose batteries
53:29
are running low foreign there's nothing we could do except wait for the end to come
53:35

At Your Service Commander Smollett that's black dog I wonder what happened
54:03
the ship and the treasure are all yours Master Philippe it was the very least I could do for you
54:11
lad you saved my life when those electromagnetic monsters were about to do me in I caught Long John and the
54:18
others off guard and I locked them up in the break you never made me feel like I was just a
54:25
robot no you made me feel human and I appreciate it
54:31
Black Dog you're more than human Commander Smollett I'm happy to report
54:37
the Hispaniola his ship shape and ready we can blast off at any time sir come
54:42
aboard and assume your command you may prepare for immediate liftoff
54:48
destination Earth
55:03
inside this container are no diamonds no platinum gold or silver but something
55:08
far more precious it is a modern Noah's Ark when Nature began to die and give way to
55:15
concrete and steel Flint gathered up all the natural wonders of Earth distilled them and
55:20
sealed them inside this great artificial Jewel I can only imagine the Wonders it
55:27
contains Because by the time I was born nature had disappeared from Earth and I
55:32
had never seen it I had heard stories about grass flowers
55:38
trees and such I'd heard about birds and butterflies forests filled with
55:44
beautiful animals of all descriptions and as I gazed at Flint's treasure
55:49
I wondered if the stories were true and if someday I would actually see the
55:55
precious Gifts of nature supposedly preserved inside the jewel
56:00
s [Music]
56:17
falling into a black hole you can thank me for this I sabotaged
56:22
your navigation computer and aimed you into the black hole to prove that nobody gets the best of Long John Silver I
56:28
should have left you behind on Treasure Planet you villain that was my one big mistake no your one big mistake wasn't
56:35
defying me that treasure belongs to me and if I can't nobody can
56:45
oh no
56:50

57:07
[Music] wow you must escape and forget about
57:14
that bastard treasure just save yourself believe the escape capsule can only carry 450
57:23
pounds and the treasure itself weighs that much
57:30
[Applause]
57:38
the treasure I had to make a choice because the escape capsule couldn't
57:44
carry both and I had to decide immediately there was no choice the treasure would
57:50
restore the glory of Earth compared to that my life was nothing
58:00
I launched the treasure Jewel earthward I stayed aboard what was left of the Hispaniola and honoring an ancient
58:07
tradition I went down with the ship down down into the black hole into an alien
58:15
dimension of time and space from which There Is No Escape now Escape
58:22
[Music]
58:33
of nothingness [Music] but it was worth it
58:39
the Escape capsules with its Precious Cargo would arrive on Earth in a few
58:44
seconds ocean
